## Hey Everyone 

# Form-Data List Project

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that manages form data. The primary functionality allows users to submit information through a form, view the submitted data in the form of cards, and perform operations like editing or deleting the user details.

## Features

- **Form Submission:** Users can enter their details in a form and submit it.
- **Data Display:** Submitted data is displayed on a read page in the form of cards.
- **Edit Functionality:** Each card includes an "Edit" button that allows users to modify their details easily.
- **Delete Functionality:** Each card also has a "Delete" button that enables users to remove their details.

## How It Works

1. **Submit Data:** Fill in the form with the required details and click the submit button.
2. **View Data:** After submission, the entered details will appear on a separate page as a card.
3. **Edit Data:** To modify any details, click on the "Edit" button on the corresponding card. The form will be pre-filled with the existing data, allowing easy updates.
4. **Delete Data:** To remove a user's details, simply click the "Delete" button on the respective card. This will permanently delete the information.

## Installation
